TITLE: Protocol for Bitcoin miners to mine Stackchain blocks.
AUTHOR: Semisol
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Standards Track
CREATED: 2022-09-12

ABSTRACT
This SIP defines how a Bitcoin miner may mine a block in the Stackchain.

PROCESS
1) A Bitcoin miner that wants to mine a Stackchain block should announce their intentions on the Stackchain. They should note down the post link to their announcement.
2) The miner can continue mining Bitcoin, while recording the power draw, electricity price ($/kWH) and money spent on miner electricity costs.
3) At the end of this period, the miner should publish:
    - A link to their starting post
    - How much was spent in total
    - How many miners they operated
    - How much Bitcoin they obtained
   in a reply to end the process.
4) The miner should submit (if requested) a redacted screenshot of their withdrawal.
5) If nodes reject the results, the miner should provide the electricity price and power draw information for further validation.
   If you did not note down this information, the process starts from zero.
6) After the published data was verified, a Stackchainer should provide a receipt to the miner with basic information about the process. This receipt can be used like any other in Stackjoins or mining blocks.
